am a motivated and detail-oriented Data Analyst with hands-on experience in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. My journey into data analytics began through structured training programs, projects, and self-learning, where I gained skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling to help businesses make informed decisions.
I am eager to apply my skills to real-world business problems and collaborate with forward-thinking teams. Currently, I’m open to entry-level Data Analyst roles where I can continue to grow, add value, and contribute to data-driven decision-making.”
